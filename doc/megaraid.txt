When using disks from existing megaraid arrays you need to first erase
foreign config from disks:

megacli -PDList -aALL | grep -B 17 -A 6 Unconfigured

megacli -CfgForeign -Scan -aALL

megacli -CfgForeign -Clear 0 -a0


repeat last command as many times as you have new Unconfigured disks
with foreign config.
