backup ganeti cluster using lvm snapshots and rsync to zfs snapshots


FIXME - add detailed installation description here


optimize logrotate to include date in filename (to prevent multiple copies
on copy-on-write filesystem like zfs)

perl -p -i -n -e 's/(\s+)daily/$1daily\n$1dateext/' /etc/logrotate.d/*
